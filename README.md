# CS 3360 - Introduction to Graphics

https://www.cs.iastate.edu/courses/com-s-3360

The main goal of this semester long project was to develop a functional Raytracing Algorithm. In the short duration of the semester only so much can be completed which can be found here. I plan to continue to work and expand, but this will be done elsewhere.

The Ray Tracer is based off of Peter Shirley's Raytracing In One Weekend Series (https://raytracing.github.io/). Additional features were added for class project completion. The additional features are:
- HDR Skyboxes (hdr backgrounds)
- Triangle Meshes
- Loading Triangle Meshes from Wavefront (.obj) format
- Loading Image Textures
- Loading Material Textures (partial)
- CPU Parellelization
